# Anne-Lii Gesar Hansen
Fullstack Developer with a Backend Focus

## About Me
I'm a fullstack developer with a strong focus on backend development, databases, and APIs.  
Studying for a Higher Education Diploma in Computer Science with a specialization in Web Development at Mid Sweden University. 
Graduating in June 2025.

Sharing some of my projects from school — some smaller, some larger, and all part of my development journey.

## School Projects

**Restaurant Etoile**  
Fullstack project created for the course "Backend-Based Web Development".

The goal was to build a company presentation website for a fictional restaurant, including:  
- A REST API built with Node.js and Express, secured with JWT authentication.  
- An admin interface for managing the menu and restaurant information.  
- A public-facing website consuming the API to display menu and company details.

The application features dynamic content management, secure user login, and responsive design.
